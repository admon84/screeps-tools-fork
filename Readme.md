Set the RCL and place structures on the map to create a base layout plan.

* Terrain and existing structures can be imported from live MMO and seasonal rooms
* Roads are visually connected together using SVGs
* Hold left-click and drag to mass-place structures
* Hold right-click and drag to mass-erase structures
